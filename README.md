Extra Math
===============

This library aims at making available to Modelica all functions defined in the
`math.h` from Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.

Visual Studio 2013 places its `math.h` header file here:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include\math.h`

Some of the functions are described on Wikipedia:
