This library aims at making available to Modelica all functions defined in the
`math.h` from Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.
These functions are documented here:  
https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh553049.aspx  
or in the Visual Studio `math.h` header file that can be found here:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include\math.h`

A more general description of mathematical functions in C is given on Wikipedia:
